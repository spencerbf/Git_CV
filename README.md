## Spencer Barton-Fisher

I am a confident and ambitious Junior Developer. With a strong analytical mind, I have embarked on a career change where I can put my skills to better use. After recruiting software developers for 18 months, I became fascinated by the intricate details of the Development landscape. I decided to enrol at Makers Academy, a 12 week intensive bootcamp.  I have grown from someone with an interest in code, to someone who is incredibly passionate about writing clean code using best practices. I am currently looking for a role within an ambitious company that promotes learning and collaboration in a team environment, where I can consolidate and extend my programming knowledge surrounded by like-minded professionals.
