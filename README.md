## Spencer Barton-Fisher

I am a hardworking, ambitious individual. I welcome new challenges  which is one of the main reasons I have enrolled at Makers Academy. The majority of my career has been within the financial sector where I have worked for two of the largest inter dealer broking companies in the world. I had one year out of finance which is when my interest in the technology industry flourished. I worked for a specialist IT recruitment company focusing on backend development as well as SAP specialist.

Once I have completed the Makers Academy I will be looking for a Junior Developer role where I can continue to learn on a daily basis within an organisation that loves developing great software. I would love to work for a company who will allow me to develop my skill set on a regular basis, working with the latest technologies and really allowing me to grow as a developer.

## Skills

#### Key skills & attributes

- Strong communication skills
- Maintain effective performance under pressure
- Leadership
- Teamwork
- Driven

Throughout my career I have worked in teams both in the finance sector and in IT recruitment. I work well both within a team and as a standalone individual using my initiative to complete the task at hand. I feel just as comfortable when acting as an integral member of a team and also when given the leadership position to having good experience within both roles. I feel that I have extremely strong communication skills which have been developed by working in high pressured environments. I work very well under pressure. In all of my roles I have worked towards tight deadlines within target driven environments.
