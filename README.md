## Spencer Barton-Fisher

I am a confident ambitious individual. My interest and passion for the Tech industry started when I left the finance sector and moved into IT recruitment for around 18 months. I welcome new challenges which is one of the main reasons I enrolled at Makers Academy. The majority of my career has been within the financial sector where I have worked for two of the largest inter-dealer brokers in the world.

Now that I have completed Makers Academy, I am looking for a Junior Developer role. I want to continue to learn on a daily basis within an organisation that loves developing great software. I would love to work for a company who will allow me to develop my skill set on a regular basis, working with the latest technologies and really allowing me to grow as a developer.

Throughout my career I have worked in teams. I work well both within a team and as a standalone individual, using my initiative to complete the task at hand.

In all of my roles I have worked towards tight deadlines within target driven environments.
